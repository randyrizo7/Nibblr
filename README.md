# Nibblr

Nibblr is a social food-discovery app that helps people decide where to eat together.  
Using swipe-based interactions, Nibblr lets users swipe on restaurants, match with friends, and surface shared favorites without endless back-and-forth.

Think: swipe-based discovery combined with taste-driven social signals, built specifically for decision-making.

## Problem Statement

Choosing a place to eat is surprisingly difficult, especially with groups.

- Group chats stall with indecision
- Recommendation platforms optimize for ratings, not people
- Too many choices lead to decision fatigue

Nibblr focuses on decisions rather than browsing by making preferences explicit and highlighting overlap between people.

## Design Philosophy

- Decisions over discovery  
  Help users choose efficiently instead of browsing endlessly.

- Social without metrics  
  No follower counts, likes, or engagement scores.

- Taste-driven signals  
  Restaurants surface based on shared preferences and group behavior, not global ratings.

- Lightweight by default  
  Reduce friction and cognitive load.
